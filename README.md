# the-weakest-space-ship

NOTE: Even though I really love raylib because it's very simple and easy to use, I did find the lack in my needs thus I moved to macroquad, it's simple just like raylib but made in pure rust, this project will no longer be maintained, instead check out this new project made by macroquad: https://github.com/LoafDev/the-weaker-space-ship

Made with raylib-rs, a rust binding for raylib with in C, this is a very simple game that is somewhat alike space invaders.
This game currently has no sound effect
